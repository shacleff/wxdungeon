# Sink Dungeon

A tiny little roguelite game.



------

Now we have 5 chapters,25 random levels,player move,melee weapon,remote shooter,random equipments,26 monsters and 10 bosses.

You can use Cocos Creator to build it,and all resources are all made by myself,you can use it for free(although it seems not good).
